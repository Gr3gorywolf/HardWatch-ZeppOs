# HardWatch ZeppOS

## Overview

**HardWatch ZeppOS** is a smartwatch application that allows you to monitor your connected devices in real time, right from your wrist. With an intuitive interface, you can track CPU, GPU, and RAM usage, and even execute predefined commands on your devices.

ðŸš¨ **Note:** HardWatch ZeppOS requires a running instance of **HardWatch Server** and **HardWatch Client** to function properly. The client must be running in the background on your devices to send data to the server.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: View live hardware statistics of all connected devices.
- **Command Execution**: Send predefined commands to your devices directly from your smartwatch.
- **Customizable Server Connection**: Enter your server IP and authentication key in the settings.
